  abstract = {Distribution models are needed to understand spatiotemporal patterns in cetacean occurrence and to mitigate anthropogenic impacts. Shipboard line-transect visual surveys are the standard method for estimating abundance and describing the distributions of cetacean populations. Ship-board surveys provide high spatial resolution but lack temporal resolution and seasonal coverage. Stationary passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) employs acoustic sensors to sample point locations nearly continuously, providing high temporal resolution in local habitats across days, seasons and years. To evaluate whether cross-platform data synthesis can improve distribution predictions, models were developed for Cuvier's beaked whales, sperm whales, and Risso's dolphins in the oceanic Gulf of Mexico using two different methods: generalized additive models and neural networks. Neural networks were able to learn unspecified interactions between drivers. Models that incorporated PAM datasets out-performed models trained on visual data alone, and joint models performed best in two out of three cases. The modeling results suggest that, when taken together, multiple species distribution models using a variety of data types may support conservation and management of Gulf of Mexico cetacean populations by improving the understanding of temporal and spatial species distribution trends.},

  author = {Kwon, David},
  abstract = {The Rice's whale Balaenoptera ricei is a newly described baleen whale on the brink of extinction that is endemic to the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoMx). Concrete understanding of its range of habitation is vital for supporting conservation efforts, but research in B. ricei's potential distribution outside American waters, suggested by historical records, is lacking. A maximum entropy algorithm was used to model habitat suitability of B. ricei in the entire GoMx, northern Caribbean, and northwestern Atlantic coastline. This was informed using ten environmental predictors, 50 historical records, and 181 extant records. Four habitat models were created that incorporated extant records alone (extant) or combined extant and historical records (augmented). The extant models recovered no suitable habitat in the southern GoMx or Caribbean, while the augmented model revealed high suitable habitat in the Bay of Campeche and Campeche Bank. Unexpectedly, both models also recovered suitable habitat in the northwestern Atlantic, where previous surveys found little evidence of B. ricei presence. This provides implications in the dwindling population's ecology that must be further investigated. In addition, this study's findings in the southern GoMx presents evidence that the species may still exist outside the northern GoMx.},

BIAs are not intended to represent all important areas for consideration in planning processes; in particular, areas of high marine mammal density, typically identified based on a combination of systematic visual and/or acoustic detections coupled with quantitative modeling, are very important to consider, where available, in any assessment. To maintain their utility, Gulf of Mexico BIAs should be re-evaluated and revised, if necessary, as new information becomes available.},

  abstract = {Marine mammals are highly vulnerable to oil spills, although the effects at both individual and population levels are not fully understood. A first approximation to evaluate the possible consequences of oil spills on marine life is using ecological risk assessments, which are analytical tools used to assess the likelihood of adverse environmental effects due to exposure to stressors derived from human activities. We developed a semi-quantitative framework to evaluate the risk of oil spill exposure on marine mammals that combines the likelihood of exposure based on species-specific biological and ecological traits, and the feasibility of encounter, which considers not only the overlap between the distribution of the species and the total affected area by a spill but also considers the distribution of spilled oil within this area, thus reducing the uncertainty in the estimate. We applied our framework to assess the risk of exposure of eight cetaceans to scenarios of large heavy oil (API gravity{$<$}22) spills originating from three hypothetical deep-water wells in the western Gulf of Mexico. High habitat suitability areas obtained using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling approach were used as a proxy for the geographic regions where each species is likely to be distributed, and oil spill scenarios were generated using numerical models incorporating transport, dispersion, and oil degradation. The analysis allowed identifying those species for which there is a significant risk of exposure in each spill scenario. However, our results suggest that the risk does not appear to be high for any species under any scenario. The information generated by our risk assessment is key to developing management plans in those areas of the Gulf of Mexico where deep-water activities of the hydrocarbon industry are currently being developed or planned.},

  abstract = {The aftermath of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill highlighted the lack of baseline spatial, behavioral, and abundance data for many species, including imperiled marine turtles, across the Gulf of Mexico. The ecology of marine turtles is closely tied to their vertical movements within the water column and is therefore critical knowledge for resource management in a changing ocean. A more comprehensive understanding of diving behavior, specifically surface intervals, can improve the accuracy of density and abundance estimates by mitigating availability bias. Here, we focus on the proportion of time marine turtles spend at the top 2 m of the water column to coincide with depths where turtles are assumed visible to observers during aerial surveys. To better understand what environmental and oceanographic conditions influence time at surface, we analyzed dive and spatial data from 136 satellite tags attached to three species of threatened or endangered marine turtles across 10 years. We fit generalized additive models with 11 remotely sensed covariates, including sea surface temperature (SST), bathymetry, and salinity, to examine dive patterns. Additionally, the developed model is the first to explicitly examine the potential connection between turtle dive patterns and ocean frontal zones in the Gulf of Mexico. Our results show species-specific associations of environmental covariates related to increased time at surface, particularly for depth, salinity, and frontal features. We define seasonal and spatial variation in time-at-surface patterns in an effort to contribute to marine turtle density and abundance estimates. These estimates could then be utilized to generate correction factors for turtle detection availability during aerial surveys.},

  abstract = {Bryde's-like whales are a complex of medium-sized baleen whales that occur in tropical waters of all three major ocean basins. Currently, a single species of Bryde's whale, Balaenoptera edeni Anderson, 1879, is recognized, with two subspecies, Eden's whale, B. edeni edeni and Bryde's whale, B. edeni brydei (Olsen, 1913), although some authors have recognized these as separate species. Recently, a new, evolutionarily divergent lineage of Bryde's-like whale was identified based on genetic data and was found to be restricted primarily to the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOMx). Here, we provide the first morphological examination of a complete skull from these whales and identify diagnostic characters that distinguish it from the other medium-sized baleen whale taxa. In addition, we have increased the number of genetic samples of these Bryde's-like whales in the GOMx from 23 to 36 individuals, all of which matched the GOMx lineage. A review of Bryde's-like whale records in the Caribbean and greater Atlantic supports an isolated distribution for this unique lineage, augmenting the genetic and morphological body of evidence supporting the existence of an undescribed species of Balaenoptera from the Gulf of Mexico.},

Under the ESA, if a petition is found to present substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted, a status review shall be commenced (16 U.S.C 1533 (b)(3)(A)). The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) determined that the petition contained substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted (80 FR 18343 2015), April 6, 2015). NMFS then requested from the public information on Bryde's whales in the GOMx including: (1) historical and current distribution, abundance, and population trends; (2) life history and biological information including adaptations to ecological settings, genetic information to assess paternal contribution and population connectivity, and movement patterns to determine population mixing; (3) management measures and regulatory mechanisms designed to protect the population; (4) any current or planned activities that may adversely impact them; and (5) ongoing or planned efforts to protect and restore the population and its habitat. The ESA stipulates listing determinations should be made on the basis of the best scientific and commercial information available. The agency convened a Status Review Team (SRT) comprised of experts in the fields of marine mammal biology and ecology, conservation biology, taxonomy, population dynamics, acoustics, and marine policy and GOMx management. The SRT reviewed all the available information, including that provided by the public, and then conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the Gulf of Mexico population of Bryde's whales that determines (1) whether the Gulf of Mexico population qualifies as a DPS, subspecies, or species; (2) summarizes the available information on the biology and threats to the population; (3) evaluates potentially significant threats to the population; and (4) assesses the extinction risk. This report describes the SRT's deliberations and conclusions. The draft status review was submitted to independent peer reviewers and comments and information received from them were addressed and incorporated as appropriate before finalizing the report.},

  abstract = {The endangered Rice's whale Balaenoptera ricei, with fewer than 100 individuals remaining, is the only year-round resident baleen whale found in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and occurs primarily along the northeastern shelf break near De Soto Canyon. Historical whaling records and predictive density modeling suggest that these whales potentially could occur more broadly throughout the GOM. High levels of anthropogenic activities in the GOM, including oil and gas exploration and extraction, fisheries, shipping, and the unprecedented Deepwater Horizon oil spill, highlight the need to better understand the distribution, ecology, and threats to this small population to improve protection of these endangered whales. We used long-term passive acoustic recordings from the northwestern GOM shelf break to explore the extent of Rice's whale distribution in the northern GOM and to evaluate whether they exhibit seasonal movements throughout this range. We describe 6 new stereotyped variants of Rice's whale long-moan calls, found predominantly in the western GOM, that share distinctive features with typical eastern long-moans, including a 150 Hz starting tone, an approximately 100 Hz tail with amplitude modulation, and a long call duration ranging from 10 to 35 s. Western long-moan variants were detected at 3 northwestern sites, occurring sporadically throughout the year on as many as 16\% of days at the westernmost site, and infrequently at an eastern core-habitat site. These results indicate that some whales persistently occur over a broader range in the GOM than previously understood, which is important to consider when designating critical habitat and assessing threats to this Critically Endangered species.},

  abstract = {The endangered Rice's whale (Balaenoptera ricei) is endemic to the Gulf of Mexico and is also the Gulf's only resident baleen whale. Limited knowledge of this species' ecology combined with the high industrialization of this region raises serious conservation concerns. As part of an ongoing project to study the Rice's whale in its core habitat, an array of moored passive acoustic monitoring sites has been near-continuously deployed in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico since May 2021. While detecting Rice's whale calls in these data provides valuable insight into the species' spatiotemporal distribution, further analyses to localize and track individual whales would allow better characterization of their acoustic behavior and movement patterns, possibly allowing for density estimation. Here, we present a method for automated passive acoustic localization and tracking of calling Rice's whales. The two key components of this approach are (1) the use of opportunistic sound sources to time-synchronize recordings across sites given clock-drift between acoustic recorders and (2) the implementation of automatic multi-target tracking techniques based on the Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density filter. Analyses of the first four months of data show potential for measuring basic behavioral parameters such as calling rate, source level, and average swim speed.},
