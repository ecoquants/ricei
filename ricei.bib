  abstract = {Density surface models (DSMs) are clearly established as a method of choice for the analysis of cetacean line transect survey data, and are increasingly used to inform risk assessments in remote marine areas subject to rising anthropogenic impacts (e.g. the high seas). However, despite persistent skepticism about the validity of extrapolated models, more and more DSMs are being applied well beyond the boundaries of the study regions where field sampling originally took place. This leads to potentially uncertain and error-prone model predictions that may mislead on-the-ground management interventions and undermine conservation decision-making. In addition, no consensus currently exists on the best way to define and measure extrapolation when it occurs, leaving users without the tools they require to audit models projected into novel conditions. Consequently, a transparent and consistent protocol for identifying scenarios under which extrapolation may be appropriate (or conversely, ill-advised) is urgently needed to better gauge how models behave outside the boundaries of sample data and to know how much faith can be placed in their outputs. This report aims to address this gap by synthesising recent advances in extrapolation detection, and presenting recommendations for a minimum standard for measuring extrapolation in novel environmental space. Such guidelines are essential to promoting transparency, replicability, and quality control, and will help marine scientists, managers and policy agencies to (i) better interpret density surfaces and their associated uncertainty; (ii) refine model development and selection approaches; and (iii) optimise the allocation of future survey effort by identifying priority knowledge gaps, e.g. by delineating areas where model predictions are the least supported by data. Our review is accompanied by supplementary R code offering a user-friendly framework for quantifying, summarising and visualising various forms of extrapolation in multivariate environmental space a priori (ahead of model fitting). We illustrate its application with case studies designed to revisit previously published predictions of sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) and beaked whale (Ziphiidae spp.) densities in the Northwest Atlantic, and evaluate them in light of several extrapolation metrics. Very early in their training, ecologists are given strong warnings against extrapolating, as model predictions made in data-deficient contexts rely heavily on assumptions that may not hold outside the range of sampled conditions. Navigating the `uncharted waters' of extrapolation, however, is critical to scientific progress, and will be best achieved with a clear understanding of the mechanics, benefits, and limitations of extrapolated models.},

Shipboard line-transect visual surveys are the standard method for estimating abundance and describing the distributions of cetacean populations. Ship-board surveys provide high spatial resolution but lack temporal resolution and seasonal coverage. Stationary passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) employs acoustic sensors to sample point locations nearly continuously, providing high temporal resolution in local habitats across days, seasons and years. To evaluate whether cross-platform data synthesis can improve distribution predictions, models were developed for Cuvier's beaked whales, sperm whales, and Risso's dolphins in the oceanic Gulf of Mexico using two different methods: generalized additive models and neural networks. Neural networks were able to learn unspecified interactions between drivers. Models that incorporated PAM datasets out-performed models trained on visual data alone, and joint models performed best in two out of three cases. The modeling results suggest that, when taken together, multiple species distribution models using a variety of data types may support conservation and management of Gulf of Mexico cetacean populations by improving the understanding of temporal and spatial species distribution trends.},

The newly recognized Rice's whale (Balaenoptera ricei) is one of the most critically endangered large whales in the world and endemic to the industrialized Gulf of Mexico. Here, we investigated the drivers of resource selection by Rice's whales in relation to prey availability and energy density. Bayesian stable isotope ({$\delta$}13C, {$\delta$}15N) mixing models suggest that Rice's whales feed primarily on a schooling fish, Ariomma bondi (66.8\% relative contribution). Prey selection using the Chesson's index revealed that active prey selection was found to be positive for three out of the four potential prey identified in the mixing model. A low degree of overlap between prey availability and diet inferred from the mixing model (Pianka Index: 0.333) suggests that prey abundance is not the primary driver of prey selection. Energy density data suggest that prey selection may be primarily driven by the energy content. Results from this study indicate~that Rice's whales are selective predators consuming schooling prey with the highest energy content. Environmental changes in the region have the potential to influence prey species that would make them less available to Rice's whales.},

  abstract = {The Rice's whale Balaenoptera ricei is a newly described baleen whale on the brink of extinction that is endemic to the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoMx). Concrete understanding of its range of habitation is vital for supporting conservation efforts, but research in B. ricei's potential distribution outside American waters, suggested by historical records, is lacking. A maximum entropy algorithm was used to model habitat suitability of B. ricei in the entire GoMx, northern Caribbean, and northwestern Atlantic coastline. This was informed using ten environmental predictors, 50 historical records, and 181 extant records. Four habitat models were created that incorporated extant records alone (extant) or combined extant and historical records (augmented). The extant models recovered no suitable habitat in the southern GoMx or Caribbean, while the augmented model revealed high suitable habitat in the Bay of Campeche and Campeche Bank. Unexpectedly, both models also recovered suitable habitat in the northwestern Atlantic, where previous surveys found little evidence of B. ricei presence. This provides implications in the dwindling population's ecology that must be further investigated. In addition, this study's findings in the southern GoMx presents evidence that the species may still exist outside the northern GoMx.},

  abstract = {Marine mammals are highly vulnerable to oil spills, although the effects at both individual and population levels are not fully understood. A first approximation to evaluate the possible consequences of oil spills on marine life is using ecological risk assessments, which are analytical tools used to assess the likelihood of adverse environmental effects due to exposure to stressors derived from human activities. We developed a semi-quantitative framework to evaluate the risk of oil spill exposure on marine mammals that combines the likelihood of exposure based on species-specific biological and ecological traits, and the feasibility of encounter, which considers not only the overlap between the distribution of the species and the total affected area by a spill but also considers the distribution of spilled oil within this area, thus reducing the uncertainty in the estimate. We applied our framework to assess the risk of exposure of eight cetaceans to scenarios of large heavy oil (API gravity{$<$}22) spills originating from three hypothetical deep-water wells in the western Gulf of Mexico. High habitat suitability areas obtained using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling approach were used as a proxy for the geographic regions where each species is likely to be distributed, and oil spill scenarios were generated using numerical models incorporating transport, dispersion, and oil degradation. The analysis allowed identifying those species for which there is a significant risk of exposure in each spill scenario. However, our results suggest that the risk does not appear to be high for any species under any scenario. The information generated by our risk assessment is key to developing management plans in those areas of the Gulf of Mexico where deep-water activities of the hydrocarbon industry are currently being developed or planned.},

The ecology of marine turtles is closely tied to their vertical movements within the water column and is therefore critical knowledge for resource management in a changing ocean. A more comprehensive understanding of diving behavior, specifically surface intervals, can improve the accuracy of density and abundance estimates by mitigating availability bias. Here, we focus on the proportion of time marine turtles spend at the top 2 m of the water column to coincide with depths where turtles are assumed visible to observers during aerial surveys. To better understand what environmental and oceanographic conditions influence time at surface, we analyzed dive and spatial data from 136 satellite tags attached to three species of threatened or endangered marine turtles across 10 years. We fit generalized additive models with 11 remotely sensed covariates, including sea surface temperature (SST), bathymetry, and salinity, to examine dive patterns. Additionally, the developed model is the first to explicitly examine the potential connection between turtle dive patterns and ocean frontal zones in the Gulf of Mexico. Our results show species-specific associations of environmental covariates related to increased time at surface, particularly for depth, salinity, and frontal features. We define seasonal and spatial variation in time-at-surface patterns in an effort to contribute to marine turtle density and abundance estimates. These estimates could then be utilized to generate correction factors for turtle detection availability during aerial surveys.},

Recently, a new, evolutionarily divergent lineage of Bryde's-like whale was identified based on genetic data and was found to be restricted primarily to the northern Gulf of Mexico (GOMx). Here, we provide the first morphological examination of a complete skull from these whales and identify diagnostic characters that distinguish it from the other medium-sized baleen whale taxa. In addition, we have increased the number of genetic samples of these Bryde's-like whales in the GOMx from 23 to 36 individuals, all of which matched the GOMx lineage. A review of Bryde's-like whale records in the Caribbean and greater Atlantic supports an isolated distribution for this unique lineage, augmenting the genetic and morphological body of evidence supporting the existence of an undescribed species of Balaenoptera from the Gulf of Mexico.},

NMFS then requested from the public information on Bryde's whales in the GOMx including: (1) historical and current distribution, abundance, and population trends; (2) life history and biological information including adaptations to ecological settings, genetic information to assess paternal contribution and population connectivity, and movement patterns to determine population mixing; (3) management measures and regulatory mechanisms designed to protect the population; (4) any current or planned activities that may adversely impact them; and (5) ongoing or planned efforts to protect and restore the population and its habitat. The ESA stipulates listing determinations should be made on the basis of the best scientific and commercial information available. The agency convened a Status Review Team (SRT) comprised of experts in the fields of marine mammal biology and ecology, conservation biology, taxonomy, population dynamics, acoustics, and marine policy and GOMx management. The SRT reviewed all the available information, including that provided by the public, and then conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the Gulf of Mexico population of Bryde's whales that determines (1) whether the Gulf of Mexico population qualifies as a DPS, subspecies, or species; (2) summarizes the available information on the biology and threats to the population; (3) evaluates potentially significant threats to the population; and (4) assesses the extinction risk. This report describes the SRT's deliberations and conclusions. The draft status review was submitted to independent peer reviewers and comments and information received from them were addressed and incorporated as appropriate before finalizing the report.},

  abstract = {The endangered Rice's whale Balaenoptera ricei, with fewer than 100 individuals remaining, is the only year-round resident baleen whale found in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and occurs primarily along the northeastern shelf break near De Soto Canyon. Historical whaling records and predictive density modeling suggest that these whales potentially could occur more broadly throughout the GOM. High levels of anthropogenic activities in the GOM, including oil and gas exploration and extraction, fisheries, shipping, and the unprecedented Deepwater Horizon oil spill, highlight the need to better understand the distribution, ecology, and threats to this small population to improve protection of these endangered whales. We used long-term passive acoustic recordings from the northwestern GOM shelf break to explore the extent of Rice's whale distribution in the northern GOM and to evaluate whether they exhibit seasonal movements throughout this range. We describe 6 new stereotyped variants of Rice's whale long-moan calls, found predominantly in the western GOM, that share distinctive features with typical eastern long-moans, including a 150 Hz starting tone, an approximately 100 Hz tail with amplitude modulation, and a long call duration ranging from 10 to 35 s. Western long-moan variants were detected at 3 northwestern sites, occurring sporadically throughout the year on as many as 16\% of days at the westernmost site, and infrequently at an eastern core-habitat site. These results indicate that some whales persistently occur over a broader range in the GOM than previously understood, which is important to consider when designating critical habitat and assessing threats to this Critically Endangered species.},

  abstract = {The endangered Rice's whale (Balaenoptera ricei) is endemic to the Gulf of Mexico and is also the Gulf's only resident baleen whale. Limited knowledge of this species' ecology combined with the high industrialization of this region raises serious conservation concerns. As part of an ongoing project to study the Rice's whale in its core habitat, an array of moored passive acoustic monitoring sites has been near-continuously deployed in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico since May 2021. While detecting Rice's whale calls in these data provides valuable insight into the species' spatiotemporal distribution, further analyses to localize and track individual whales would allow better characterization of their acoustic behavior and movement patterns, possibly allowing for density estimation. Here, we present a method for automated passive acoustic localization and tracking of calling Rice's whales. The two key components of this approach are (1) the use of opportunistic sound sources to time-synchronize recordings across sites given clock-drift between acoustic recorders and (2) the implementation of automatic multi-target tracking techniques based on the Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density filter. Analyses of the first four months of data show potential for measuring basic behavioral parameters such as calling rate, source level, and average swim speed.},

  abstract = {"Under the 1994 amendments of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) were required to generate stock assessment reports (SARs) for all marine mammal stocks in waters within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The first reports for the Atlantic (includes the Gulf of Mexico) were published in July 1995 (Blaylock et al. 1995). The MMPA requires NMFS and USFWS to review these reports annually for strategic stocks of marine mammals and at least every 3 years for stocks determined to be non-strategic. Included in this report as appendices are: 1) a summary of serious injury/mortality estimates of marine mammals in observed U.S. fisheries (Appendix I), 2) a summary of NMFS records of large whale human-caused serious injury and mortality (Appendix II), 3) detailed fisheries information (Appendix III), 4) summary tables of abundance estimates generated over recent years and the surveys from which they are derived (Appendix IV), a summary of observed fisheries bycatch (Appendix V), and a list of reports not updated in the current year (Appendix VI). Table 1 contains a summary, by species, of the information included in the stock assessments, and also indicates those that have been revised since the 2014 publication. Most of the changes incorporate new information into sections on population size and/or mortality estimates. A total of 43 of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico stock assessment reports were revised for 2015. The revised SARs include 27 strategic and 16 non-strategic stocks. This report was prepared by staff of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) and Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC). NMFS staff presented the reports at the February 2014 meeting of the Atlantic Scientific Review Group (ASRG), and subsequent revisions were based on their contributions and constructive criticism. This is a working document and individual stock assessment reports will be updated as new information becomes available and as changes to marine mammal stocks and fisheries occur. The authors solicit any new information or comments which would improve future stock assessment reports"--Executive Summary. [doi:10.7289/V57S7KTN(http://doi.org/10.7289/V57S7KTN)]},
